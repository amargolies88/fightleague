1. Set up your development environment: Install Node.js and MongoDB on your computer, and set up a code editor or integrated development environment (IDE) to work with Node.js and React.

2. Create a new Node.js project: Use the npm package manager to create a new Node.js project and install the necessary dependencies, including Socket.IO and any other libraries you plan to use.

3. Set up your server-side code: Write the server-side code for your Socket.IO application, including the code to handle incoming connections, send and receive messages, and interact with your database.

4. Set up your client-side code: Write the client-side code for your React application, including the code to connect to the server and handle incoming messages.

5. Test your application locally: Run your application locally to test it and make sure everything is working as expected.

6. Set up your MongoDB database: Create a free MongoDB database instance, and configure your server-side code to connect to it.

7. Deploy your application to Heroku: Create a new Heroku app, configure it to use your Node.js project, and deploy your code using Git or another deployment method.

8. Test your application on Heroku: Visit your Heroku app in a web browser, and test it to make sure everything is working as expected.

9. Iterate and improve: Continue to develop and improve your application, using the tools and resources available in the Node.js, Socket.IO, React, and MongoDB ecosystems.
